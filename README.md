# üåå fract-ol

## Description
**fract-ol** is a project focused on exploring and visualizing fractals. It allows users to generate and manipulate various fractal patterns using different parameters and rendering techniques.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo on your machine;
2. Run `make`, this will also clone the mini-libx for Linux;
3. To start the program, run `./fractol mandelbrot` or `./fractol julia -0.8 0.156`
	- Note: these values for Julia are just an example;
	- Julia will render differently based on the values you give it.

Once the window opens, you can use the following keybinds:

| Input | Action |
|-|-|
| `‚Üë` `‚Üì` `‚Üê` `‚Üí` | Move the fractal |
| `I` `O` `mouseWheel` | Zoom in and zoom out |
| `+` `-` | Increase and lower the definition |
| `‚ùå` `ESC` | Close the window |
| `mousePointer` | Only for Julia: the fractal mutes based on the position of the curson on the window taking the x and the y as the two values for the render |

## Grade
Still doing the project.
